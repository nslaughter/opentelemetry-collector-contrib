  If there were multiple Clusters, Datastore metrics were being repeated under Resources differentiated with a
  `vcenter.cluster.name` resource attribute. In the same vein, if there were standalone Hosts, in addition to
  clusters the metrics would be repeated under a Resource without the `vcenter.cluster.name` attribute. Now there
  will only be a single set of metrics for one Datastore (as there should be, as Datastores don't belong to
  Clusters).
