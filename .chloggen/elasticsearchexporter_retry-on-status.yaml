  Previously, the status codes that trigger retries were hardcoded to be 429, 500, 502, 503, 504.
  It is now configurable using `retry.retry_on_status`, and defaults to `[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` to avoid a breaking change.
  To avoid duplicates, it is recommended to configure `retry.retry_on_status` to `[429]`, which would be the default in a future version.
