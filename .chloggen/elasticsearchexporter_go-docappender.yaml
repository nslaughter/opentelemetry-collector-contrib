  Replace go-elasticsearch BulkIndexer with go-docappender bulk indexer, in preparation for future reliability fixes.
  As a result of this change, there are minor behavioral differences:
  - flush timeout is now enforced on client side
  - oversize payload special handling is now removed
  - go-docappender uses bulk request filterPath which means bulk response is smaller, less JSON parsing and lower CPU usage
  - document level retry debug logging is removed as retries are done transparently

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
