  The snake_case is required in OTel Collector config fields. It used to be enforced by tests in cmd/oteltestbedcol,
  but we had to disable them. Now, the tests are going to be enforced on every component independently. 
  Hence, the camelCase config fields recently added with the new AWS Cloud Map resolver has to be fixed.
